<h1>Workload & Reasoning Study</h1>
<p>
We invite you to participate in a research study conducted by
investigators from Washington University in St. Louis.  The purpose of
the study is to evaluate how different representations of Bayesian data impact cognitive load. </p>



<h3>Instructions</h3>
<ul>

	<li>Please set your browser to full screen and stay on the page until the end of the study. </li><br>
	<li>In this HIT, you will complete two Statistical Reasoning tasks. In each task, you will estimate a true positive rate based on the data provided. For one of those two tasks, you will need to remember a dot pattern while you complete it, and reproduce it after the task. After each Statistical Reasoning task, you will be asked about the effort you exerted.</li>
	<li>Finally, we will conduct a Spatial Ability Test and a short demographic questionnaire. </li>
	<li> The average completion time is 20 minutes</li>

	<li><strong>Payment</strong></li>
